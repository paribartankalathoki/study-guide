- What is Angular?
    > Angular is a Typescript-based open-source framework for building client-side web applications developed and supported by Google.
    
    > Angular is a client-side JavaScript framework that was specifically designed to help developers build SPAs (Single Page Applications) in accordance with best practices for web development.

    > Single-Page Applications (or SPAâ€™s) are applications that are accessed via a web browser like other websites but offer more dynamic interactions resembling native mobile and desktop apps. The most notable difference between a regular website and SPA is the reduced amount of page refreshes. SPAs have a heavier usage of AJAX- a way to communicate with back-end servers without doing a full page refresh to get data loaded into our application. As a result, the process of rendering pages happens mostly on the client-side.
